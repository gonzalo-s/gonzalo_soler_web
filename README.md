This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## About This Page

Hey there! üëã This is my online resume ‚Äì think of it as a chill space where I'll be showcasing all the awesome projects I've been a part of. üöÄ

This app is designed to present my professional journey, skills, and projects in a structured and visually appealing way. While it might seem like overkill to use a dedicated `sections.ts` file for managing content, this approach is intentional. It mimics the architecture I would use if the data were coming from a CMS, ensuring scalability and maintainability for future enhancements.

## What You'll Find Here
